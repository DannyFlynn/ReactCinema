#Cinema API (The Movie DB)

I created this project using React JS. For the api calls I used Axios and for the main content the Axios call is within the useEffect hook.
The hook will update when the page is changed or a new option is selected such as going from popular to top rated.
This project enables the user to search and select movies.
